# Smooth Shopping

*Empowering Food Bank Clients with the Dignity of Choice*

Smooth Shopping enables food banks to allow their clients to shop for goods online using an monthly credit system. In the backend, Smooth Shopping provides a customer management, inventory managment and order processing system.

Back end: Decoupled Drupal | Front end: a React app.

Developed in partnership with the [House of Omeed](https://houseofomeed.ca/) during #HACKVAN2021.
